"Have you ever thought what it's like to be wanderers in the Fourth Dimension? Have you? To be exiles? Susan and I are cut off from our own planet — without friends or protection. But one day we shall get back. Yes, one day."

"Our lives are different to anybody else's. That's the exciting thing! There's nobody in the universe can do what we're doing."

"Courage isn't just a matter of not being frightened, you know. It's being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway."

"There's no point in being grown up if you can't be childish sometimes."

"For some people, small, beautiful events are what life is all about!"

"Planets come and go. Stars perish. Matter disperses, coalesces, forms into other patterns, other worlds. Nothing can be eternal."

"Time will tell. It always does."

"I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there."

"What I did, I did without choice. In the name of peace and sanity."

"I'm a Time Lord. I'm the last of the Time Lords. They're all gone. I'm the only survivor. I'm left traveling on my own, 'cos there's no one else."

"I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord. I'm from the planet Gallifrey in the Constellation of Kasterborous. I'm 903 years old and I'm the man who is gonna save your lives and all 6 billion people on the planet below. You got a problem with that?"

"There's something you better understand about me, 'cause it's important and one day your life may depend on it. I am definitely a madman with a box!"

"Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose."

"None of us know for sure what's out there. That's why we keep looking. Keep your faith. Travel hopefully. The universe will surprise you. Constantly."
